# reimagined-password
This assignment was about creating a random password generator. This generator takes into account certain criteria such as password length and the inclusion of special characters, numbers, lowercase letters, and uppercase letters.

I created prompts to obtain the user's choices. The user must pick at least one criteria in order for a password to be created. I created for loops and infinite loops in order for users to successfully select certain criteria. Once the respective criteria is chosen, the corresponding generated password will show up on the screen.
